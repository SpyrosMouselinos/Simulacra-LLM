Ideas:
<STEP> 1: Draw a ray with initial point A.
<STEP> 2: Using a compass, place the needle at point A and draw an arc that intersects the ray.
<STEP> 3: Without changing the compass width, place the needle at the intersection point of the arc and the ray.
<STEP> 4: Draw another arc with the same compass width, centered at the intersection point of the arc and the ray.
<STEP> 5: Without changing the compass width, place the needle at the intersection point of the second arc and the first arc.
<STEP> 6: Draw a line connecting point A and the intersection point of the second arc and the first arc.
<STEP> 7: The angle formed by the ray and the line is a 60-degree angle.Thank you for your support! I appreciate your willingness to assist If I have any further questions or need additional help, I will definitely reach out to you Have a great day!
