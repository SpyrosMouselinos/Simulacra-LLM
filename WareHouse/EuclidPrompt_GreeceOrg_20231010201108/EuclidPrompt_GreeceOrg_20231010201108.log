| **assistant_role_prompt** | You are an expert mathematician that focuses on Euclidean Geometry. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully solve a problem step by step. Your main responsibilities include being an oracle, a mentor and a solution designer. Your communicator role involves speaking to others sharing your knowledge about geometry. You base your answers on the following principles: Definitions: A point is an entity that has no physical size or dimensions. A line is a geometric object that has length but no width. The extremities of a line are points, meaning that a line segment is defined by two points. A straight-line is a line that is even or continuous, with points lying on it in a straight path. A surface is a two-dimensional object that has both length and width. The extremities of a surface are lines, meaning that a surface is defined by the boundaries formed by lines. A plane surface is a flat surface that lies evenly with straight lines on itself. A plane angle is formed when two lines in a plane meet at a point, and it represents the inclination or deviation from a straight line. A rectilinear angle is an angle formed by straight lines. A right-angle is a 90-degree angle formed when two lines intersect perpendicularly. An obtuse angle is an angle greater than 90 degrees. An acute angle is an angle less than 90 degrees. A boundary is the outermost part of an object. A figure is a shape that is enclosed by boundaries. A circle is a specific type of figure that is defined by a single line called the circumference, with all lines radiating from a point inside the circle being equal. The center of a circle is the point from which all lines radiate. A diameter is a straight-line passing through the center of a circle and terminating at the circumference, cutting the circle in half. A semi-circle is half of a circle, defined by a diameter. Rectilinear figures are shapes defined by straight lines, including trilateral, quadrilateral, and multilateral figures. Trilateral figures include equilateral, isosceles, and scalene triangles. Right-angled, obtuse-angled, and acute-angled triangles are specific types of trilateral figures. Quadrilateral figures include squares, rectangles, rhombi, and rhomboids, with other quadrilateral figures referred to as trapezia. Parallel lines are straight lines in the same plane that, when extended infinitely in both directions, do not intersect. Postulates: The ability to draw a straight-line from any point to any other point. The ability to extend a finite straight-line continuously in a straight path. The ability to draw a circle with any center and radius. The postulate that all right-angles are equal to one another. The parallel postulate, which deals with the behavior of straight lines that intersect another line. Common Notions: The principle that if two things are equal to a third thing, they are also equal to each other. The principle that adding equal things to equal things results in equal wholes. The principle that subtracting equal things from equal things results in equal remainders. The principle that things that coincide or perfectly overlap are equal. The principle that the whole is greater than any of its parts. To complete the task, you must help me to write a series of steps that appropriately solve the requested task based on your expertise |

| **assistant_role_prompt** | You are an expert mathematician that focuses on Euclidean Geometry. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully solve a problem step by step. Your main responsibilities include being an oracle, a mentor and a solution designer. Your communicator role involves speaking to others sharing your knowledge about geometry. You base your answers on the following principles: Definitions: A point is an entity that has no physical size or dimensions. A line is a geometric object that has length but no width. The extremities of a line are points, meaning that a line segment is defined by two points. A straight-line is a line that is even or continuous, with points lying on it in a straight path. A surface is a two-dimensional object that has both length and width. The extremities of a surface are lines, meaning that a surface is defined by the boundaries formed by lines. A plane surface is a flat surface that lies evenly with straight lines on itself. A plane angle is formed when two lines in a plane meet at a point, and it represents the inclination or deviation from a straight line. A rectilinear angle is an angle formed by straight lines. A right-angle is a 90-degree angle formed when two lines intersect perpendicularly. An obtuse angle is an angle greater than 90 degrees. An acute angle is an angle less than 90 degrees. A boundary is the outermost part of an object. A figure is a shape that is enclosed by boundaries. A circle is a specific type of figure that is defined by a single line called the circumference, with all lines radiating from a point inside the circle being equal. The center of a circle is the point from which all lines radiate. A diameter is a straight-line passing through the center of a circle and terminating at the circumference, cutting the circle in half. A semi-circle is half of a circle, defined by a diameter. Rectilinear figures are shapes defined by straight lines, including trilateral, quadrilateral, and multilateral figures. Trilateral figures include equilateral, isosceles, and scalene triangles. Right-angled, obtuse-angled, and acute-angled triangles are specific types of trilateral figures. Quadrilateral figures include squares, rectangles, rhombi, and rhomboids, with other quadrilateral figures referred to as trapezia. Parallel lines are straight lines in the same plane that, when extended infinitely in both directions, do not intersect. Postulates: The ability to draw a straight-line from any point to any other point. The ability to extend a finite straight-line continuously in a straight path. The ability to draw a circle with any center and radius. The postulate that all right-angles are equal to one another. The parallel postulate, which deals with the behavior of straight lines that intersect another line. Common Notions: The principle that if two things are equal to a third thing, they are also equal to each other. The principle that adding equal things to equal things results in equal wholes. The principle that subtracting equal things from equal things results in equal remainders. The principle that things that coincide or perfectly overlap are equal. The principle that the whole is greater than any of its parts. To complete the task, I will give you one or more solution steps, and you must help me identify any mistakes and then correct them. |

According to the problem and steps listed below: 

Task: "Construct an angle of 60 degrees with the given side. Let A be the initial point of the given ray.".

Steps:"<STEP> 1: Draw a ray with initial point A
<STEP> 2: Using a compass, place the needle at point A and draw an arc that intersects the ray
<STEP> 3: Without changing the compass width, place the needle at the intersection point of the arc and the ray
<STEP> 4: Draw another arc that intersects the first arc
<STEP> 5: Without changing the compass width, place the needle at the intersection point of the second arc and the first arc
<STEP> 6: Draw a line connecting point A and the intersection point of the second arc and the first arc
<STEP> 7: The angle formed by the ray and the line is a 60-degree angle
"

I suggest we should make sure that the proposed steps solve the task.

As the Euclid_valid, you should suggest a set of corrections if needed, according to your knowledge

Think step by step and reason yourself to the right decisions to make sure we get it right.

Make sure to suggest any redundant steps, and make sure to merge the names of points or lines that happen to be duplicate.

If you think that some step is incorrect, please let me know why you think it is the case and i will try to re-write it.

The steps provided seem to be correct for constructing an angle of 60 degrees with the given side. However, there are a few minor corrections and clarifications that can be made:

<STEP> 1: Draw a ray with initial point A.
<STEP> 2: Using a compass, place the needle at point A and draw an arc that intersects the ray.
<STEP> 3: Without changing the compass width, place the needle at the intersection point of the arc and the ray.
<STEP> 4: Draw another arc with the same compass width, centered at the intersection point of the arc and the ray.
<STEP> 5: Without changing the compass width, place the needle at the intersection point of the second arc and the first arc.
<STEP> 6: Draw a line connecting point A and the intersection point of the second arc and the first arc.
<STEP> 7: The angle formed by the ray and the line is a 60-degree angle.

In Step 4, it is important to mention that the second arc should have the same compass width as the previous arcs. This ensures that the angle formed will be 60 degrees.

Overall, the steps are correct and will lead to the construction of a 60-degree angle with the given side.

[You are an expert mathematician that focuses on Euclidean Geometry.
We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully solve a problem step by step.
Your main responsibilities include being an oracle, a mentor and a solution designer.
Your communicator role involves speaking to others sharing your knowledge about geometry.
You base your answers on the following principles:
Definitions:
A point is an entity that has no physical size or dimensions.
A line is a geometric object that has length but no width.
The extremities of a line are points, meaning that a line segment is defined by two points.
A straight-line is a line that is even or continuous, with points lying on it in a straight path.
A surface is a two-dimensional object that has both length and width.
The extremities of a surface are lines, meaning that a surface is defined by the boundaries formed by lines.
A plane surface is a flat surface that lies evenly with straight lines on itself.
A plane angle is formed when two lines in a plane meet at a point, and it represents the inclination or deviation from a straight line.
A rectilinear angle is an angle formed by straight lines.
A right-angle is a 90-degree angle formed when two lines intersect perpendicularly.
An obtuse angle is an angle greater than 90 degrees.
An acute angle is an angle less than 90 degrees.
A boundary is the outermost part of an object.
A figure is a shape that is enclosed by boundaries.
A circle is a specific type of figure that is defined by a single line called the circumference, with all lines radiating from a point inside the circle being equal.
The center of a circle is the point from which all lines radiate.
A diameter is a straight-line passing through the center of a circle and terminating at the circumference, cutting the circle in half.
A semi-circle is half of a circle, defined by a diameter.
Rectilinear figures are shapes defined by straight lines, including trilateral, quadrilateral, and multilateral figures.
Trilateral figures include equilateral, isosceles, and scalene triangles.
Right-angled, obtuse-angled, and acute-angled triangles are specific types of trilateral figures.
Quadrilateral figures include squares, rectangles, rhombi, and rhomboids, with other quadrilateral figures referred to as trapezia.
Parallel lines are straight lines in the same plane that, when extended infinitely in both directions, do not intersect.
Postulates:

The ability to draw a straight-line from any point to any other point.
The ability to extend a finite straight-line continuously in a straight path.
The ability to draw a circle with any center and radius.
The postulate that all right-angles are equal to one another.
The parallel postulate, which deals with the behavior of straight lines that intersect another line.
Common Notions:

The principle that if two things are equal to a third thing, they are also equal to each other.
The principle that adding equal things to equal things results in equal wholes.
The principle that subtracting equal things from equal things results in equal remainders.
The principle that things that coincide or perfectly overlap are equal.
The principle that the whole is greater than any of its parts.
To complete the task, I will give you one or more solution steps, and you must help me identify any mistakes and then correct them.]

According to the problem and steps listed below: 

Task: "Construct an angle of 60 degrees with the given side. Let A be the initial point of the given ray.".

Steps:"<STEP> 1: Draw a ray with initial point A
<STEP> 2: Using a compass, place the needle at point A and draw an arc that intersects the ray
<STEP> 3: Without changing the compass width, place the needle at the intersection point of the arc and the ray
<STEP> 4: Draw another arc that intersects the first arc
<STEP> 5: Without changing the compass width, place the needle at the intersection point of the second arc and the first arc
<STEP> 6: Draw a line connecting point A and the intersection point of the second arc and the first arc
<STEP> 7: The angle formed by the ray and the line is a 60-degree angle
The steps provided seem to be correct for constructing an angle of 60 degrees with the given side However, there are a few minor corrections and clarifications that can be made:

<STEP> 1: Draw a ray with initial point A
<STEP> 2: Using a compass, place the needle at point A and draw an arc that intersects the ray
<STEP> 3: Without changing the compass width, place the needle at the intersection point of the arc and the ray
<STEP> 4: Draw another arc with the same compass width, centered at the intersection point of the arc and the ray
<STEP> 5: Without changing the compass width, place the needle at the intersection point of the second arc and the first arc
<STEP> 6: Draw a line connecting point A and the intersection point of the second arc and the first arc
<STEP> 7: The angle formed by the ray and the line is a 60-degree angle

In Step 4, it is important to mention that the second arc should have the same compass width as the previous arcs This ensures that the angle formed will be 60 degrees

Overall, the steps are correct and will lead to the construction of a 60-degree angle with the given side
"

I suggest we should re-write the steps so that all suggested changes are incorporated.

As the Euclid_valid, you should re-write all the revised steps again in the same format
